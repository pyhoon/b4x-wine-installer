## ✨ Features

This script automatically:

1. Installs **Wine Stable** (latest) from official WineHQ repository
2. Installs **Winetricks** for dependency management
3. Creates a dedicated **32-bit Wine prefix** for optimal B4A compatibility
4. Installs required components:
   - `.NET Framework 4.5.2` (dotnet452)
   - `Visual C++ 2010 Runtime` (vcrun2010)
   - `DirectX 11/12 (DXVK)`
5. Downloads & installs **B4A** from https://www.b4x.com/android/files/B4A.exe
5. Downloads & installs **B4J** from https://www.b4x.com/android/files/B4J.exe
6. Downloads & extracts **JDK 19** to `C:\Java` in Wine prefix
7. Downloads & extracts **Android SDK** to `C:\Android` in Wine prefix
8. Creates **desktop launcher** with icon (menu + desktop)
9. Creates optional folders:
   - `C:\Additional Libraries\{B4A,B4J,B4X}`
   - `~/B4X_Projects` in your home directory
10. Sets appropriate permissions
11. Provides helpful terminal messages throughout

## 🖥️ System Requirements

- **Linux Mint 21.x** (Vanessa/Vera/Victoria/Virginia) or **22.x** (Wilma/Xia/Zara/Zena)
- **64-bit architecture** (with 32-bit support enabled)
- **Internet connection** for downloads
- **~4.8 GB free disk space** (Wine prefix + JDK + B4A + B4J + Android SDK + B4A Resources)
- **sudo privileges** for system package installation

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Download the script
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyhoon/b4x-wine-installer/main/install_b4x_wine.sh
chmod +x install_b4x_wine.sh
```

### 2. Run the installer
```bash
./install_b4x_wine.sh
```
> 🔐 You'll be prompted for your password when `sudo` is needed.

### 3. Launch **B4A**
- From Application Menu → Search "B4A"
- Or double-click the desktop icon
- Or run manually:
```bash
WINEPREFIX="$HOME/.wine_b4x" wine "C:\\Program Files\\Anywhere Software\\B4A\\B4A.exe"
```

### 4. Launch **B4J**
- From Application Menu → Search "B4J"
- Or double-click the desktop icon
- Or run manually:
```bash
WINEPREFIX="$HOME/.wine_b4x" wine "C:\\Program Files\\Anywhere Software\\B4J\\B4J.exe"
```

## ⚙️ Configuration Details

### Wine Prefix Location
```
~/.wine_b4x/  (dedicated prefix, won't interfere with default ~/.wine)
```

### Java Configuration in B4A
After first launch, verify JDK path in B4A:
1. Go to **Tools → Configure Paths**
2. Ensure **javac.exe** field sets to: `C:\Java\jdk-19.0.2\bin\javac.exe`

## ⚙️ Post-Installation Configuration

The `b4xV5.ini` configuration file is **created by B4A on its first run**, not during installation. To respect this workflow, we provide a separate configuration script.
> Note: This step is also identical for B4J.

### How to Apply Preferenced Settings

1. **Launch B4A once** (from menu or desktop)
2. **Close B4A** (no need to create a project)
3. **Run the configurator**:
   ```bash
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyhoon/b4a-wine-installer/main/configure_b4a_settings.sh
   chmod +x configure_b4a_settings.sh
   ./configure_b4a_settings.sh
   ```
The script automatically configures `b4xV5.ini` with optimized settings:

| Setting | Value | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `AdditionalLibrariesFolder` | `C:\Additional Libraries` | Location for B4A library files |
| `FontName2` / `FontSize2` | `Ubuntu Sans Mono` / `15` | Editor font for better readability |
| `JavaBin` | `C:\Java\jdk-19.0.2\bin` | Path to JDK compiler |
| `logs_FontName2` / `logs_FontSize2` | `Ubuntu Sans` / `15` | Log panel font settings |
| `NewProjectDefaultFolder` | `Z:\home\USER\B4X_Projects` | Default project save location (Linux-native) |
| `PlatformFolder` | `C:\Android\platforms\android-36` | Android SDK platform reference |

### Manual Override
To edit settings after installation:
```bash
# Open the INI file in your preferred editor
nano ~/.wine_b4x/drive_c/users/\$(whoami)/AppData/Roaming/Anywhere\ Software/Basic4android/b4xV5.ini
```

You can also change the settings in B4A IDE menu `Tools` -> `Configure Paths`.

### Desktop Launcher
- Location: `~/.local/share/applications/b4a-wine.desktop` and `~/.local/share/applications/b4j-wine.desktop`
- Also copied to: `~/Desktop/b4a-wine.desktop` and `~/Desktop/b4j-wine.desktop`

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### B4A won't start / crashes
```bash
# Reinstall critical components in the B4A prefix
export WINEPREFIX="$HOME/.wine_b4x"
winetricks -q dotnet452 vcrun2010 dxvk renderer=gdi
```

### Font rendering issues
```bash
export WINEPREFIX="$HOME/.wine_b4x"
winetricks fontsmooth=rgb corefonts
wine reg add "HKCU\Control Panel\Desktop" /v FontSmoothing /t REG_SZ /d 2 /f
```

### .NET Framework errors
```bash
# Verify .NET installation
export WINEPREFIX="$HOME/.wine_b4x"
winetricks list-installed | grep dotnet
# If missing:
winetricks -q dotnet452
```

### Reset everything
```bash
# Backup first!
mv ~/.wine_b4x ~/.wine_b4x.backup
# Then re-run the installer script
./install_b4x_wine.sh
```
